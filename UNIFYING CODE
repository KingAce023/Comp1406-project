Capture The Flag
//This is documentation on how we will unify our code:

//For the code that is not in the
//specific players(Random Walker, Catcher...etc.).
//We decided to use the professor's files (re-download to make sure we are all the same)
//Then download Ose's code for Entity, Player and RandomWalker (copy paste his manageException to your specific players)
//then delete the professor's files for Entity, Player and RandomWalker (because now we have Ose's files).

//One more thing: Our Field is still not unified (the update method's try and catch) but as far as I know, we all did the same thing.

// Pending request: 
//Ose-->Can you upload your Field file, just so that we are all sure that we are dealing with the same files? Thanks.

// UPDATE: Ose has uploaded his Field, we will download it along with Entity, RandomWalker and Player.
